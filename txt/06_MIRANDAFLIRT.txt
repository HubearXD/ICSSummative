> Miranda: Hey you must be Conner, right? I’ve heard your name quite a bit and you seem pretty smart. Random question: have you read the manga Owari no Seraph?
> Me: “Umm….nope. I don’t exactly read manga.”
> Miranda: “Aw...that’s a shame.”
> Me: “What else do you do in your spare time? I’m guessing you spend a lot of time studying math since you told me to get a perfect score on the AMC 12.”
> Miranda: “Oh yeah, I do a bit of math. How about you?”
> Me: “Well I practice here and there. I always do some of Ms. Elamad’s math homework.”
> Miranda: “Ew. Why would you do that homework? It’s optional and really boring. If you want legit practice, I can tutor you after school.”
