> Mom: “CONNER!!!”
> I open my eyes drowsily to see my mother, a woman in her mid-40s, smiling at me.
> Me: “Huh? What day is it?”
> Mom: “It’s Tuesday! It’s also your first day of school! Hurry and make a good impression on you teachers! I packed your lunch. It’s on the table down in the kitchen. Have a nice day honey!”
> She gives me a big fat smooch on the cheek. I hate it when she does that! I leave the room without uttering another word.

> Seems like mom packed my “lunch” wrong again. A greasy tuna sandwich that’s been sitting in the fridge for 2 weeks? No way I’m eating that, even if YOU force me to.
