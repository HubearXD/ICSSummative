Your Mom: “CONNER!!!”
> Me: I open my eyes drowsily to see my mother, a woman in her mid-40s, smiling at me.
> Me: “Huh? What day is it?”
> Your Mom: “It’s Tuesday! It’s also your first day of Preschool! Hurry and make a good impression on you teachers! I packed your lunch. It’s on the table down in the kitchen. Have a nice day honey!”
> I receive big fat smooch on the cheek. I hate it when she does that. To show my discontempt, I leave the room without uttering another word.
